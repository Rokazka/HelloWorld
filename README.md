# HelloWorld
My first repo on git!
I created server that run on port 8000. Its starts by running "npm run dev" command. 

Ive learned one more thing: GITHUB!

1. I have to add files by running following command: "git add ."
2. Then I have to commit files by running command "git commit -m "My commit""
3. And finally push changes into repository by "git push"
4. WÅ‚ala! :D
